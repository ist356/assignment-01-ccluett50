## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

I freshened up how to use if, elif, else ladder statements, along with while loops. While loops allowed me to continually prompt the number, helping me append the integers to the list. In addition, this assignment helped me understand the push and commit of python files from vscode to github. While I was able to easily understand the coding aspect of the assignment, I struggled with vscode as it was my first time using github and vscode for coding. The instructions helped me understand where to locate and access specific functions in vscode, expecially how to find which lines of the test were errors, and then change the function in python to fit the test statements. Additionally, I was having signing in troubles and a lot of setup errors for my python. My goal in the coming weeks is to better understand vscode and how to properly send my python and update it in the github cloud. Overall this assignment helped me recall some of the python building blocks from past courses (as I have learned different languages in the past semesters). In addition, I learned testing, and how to use vscode to effectively understand errors in my code without having to look at every line. Finally, I have learned new functions in vscode, and how to commit my work to the github class cloud.
